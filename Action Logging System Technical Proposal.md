# Action Logging System Technical Proposal

## 1. Introduction

In this technical proposal, we outline the design and implementation of an Action Logging System, which will allow the tracking and auditing of actions taken within an application. This system will help in monitoring and managing module activities, provide detailed logs, and support actions such as rollback and history viewing. The system will be configured to log module activities, record model actions, and link them together for comprehensive auditing.

## 2. System Configuration

### 2.1. Modules Configuration

The system will allow for the definition of modules to log. Modules represent the distinct components or features of the application that require monitoring. Examples of modules could include user management, inventory, sales, and more.

### 2.2. Model Configuration

Within each module, model files will be defined. Each model represents a data structure or entity within the module. For each model, developers can specify the priority for logging, which determines the level of detail captured in the logs.

## 3. Logging System

### 3.1. Request Logging

Based on the configuration, the system will log module requests, attaching a unique identifier (UUID) to each request. Request details such as the request body, headers, and user information (if authentication is enabled) will be captured.

### 3.2. Model Action Logging

Within each request log, the system will log model actions, which include "Created," "Updated," and "Deleted" actions. The logging will be as follows:

- On "Created": Log the object of model creation.
- On "Updated": Log the old object before the update and the new object after the update.
- On "Deleted": Log the deletion action.

Each model log will be linked with its corresponding request log record using the request UUID.

## 4. Actions

### 4.1. Developer Access

- **Rollback:** Developers can initiate a rollback action, which involves deleting created records, forcing updates to old objects for updated action logs, and recreating deleted objects.

- **Show History of User Requests:** Developers can access the history of user requests, allowing them to track and understand the actions taken by users.

### 4.2. Model Records Log

- **Clarify Changes:** Developers can view the details of changes made to a specific model record.

- **Force Update to Old Object:** In cases where an action needs to be corrected, developers can force an update to the old object, reverting it to a previous state.

- **Show All History Logs for This Record:** This action provides a comprehensive history log for a specific model record, displaying all changes and actions related to that record.

## 5. System Implementation

The system will be implemented using a combination of programming languages, databases, and web-based interfaces. Key components include:

- A backend service for request and action logging.
- A database for storing logs and configuration settings.
- Web-based user interfaces for configuration, history viewing, and rollback actions.
- Developer authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to logs and actions.

## 6. Conclusion

The proposed Action Logging System will provide a robust and comprehensive solution for tracking, auditing, and managing actions within an application. It will be highly configurable, allowing developers to tailor the system to their specific needs, and it will support actions like rollback and detailed history viewing to facilitate troubleshooting and compliance efforts. The implementation of this system will require a dedicated development effort and ongoing maintenance to ensure its effectiveness.
