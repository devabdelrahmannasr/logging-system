# Proposal: Queue Implementation in Action Logging System

## Introduction

This proposal outlines the implementation of queues within the Action Logging System. The use of queues is essential for managing and processing log entries efficiently. We will utilize Redis as a message broker and Supervisor to manage worker processes for consuming log entries from the queues.

## Queue Implementation Details

### 1. Redis as the Message Broker

Redis will serve as the message broker for the queues. The queues will be created and managed within Redis.

### 2. Queues Structure

We propose creating two primary queues:

- **Request Queue:** This queue will receive incoming log entries related to module requests. Each log entry will be added to the Request Queue.

- **Model Log Queue:** This queue is optional and will receive log entries related to model-specific actions within requests. It allows for separate processing if needed.

### 3. Supervisor for Worker Process Management

Supervisor will be used to manage worker processes responsible for consuming log entries from the queues.
